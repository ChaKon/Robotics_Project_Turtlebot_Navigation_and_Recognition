Robotics_Project_Turtlebot_Navigation_and_Recognition
=====================================================

This work is part of masters project. This work was done together with Sai Krishna Pathi, Jampy & Chalikonda Prabhu Kumar

It contains two parts

Part I

It is about creating the package for the turtlebot to navigate with and without obstacles choosing optimal path to reach the goal. This was done using python and videos are included.

Part II

In this we have to recognize the image (Kinect mounted on turtlebot) in the environment and turtlebot should move using navigation algorithms used in first part and should stop infront of the image.
Phython scripts were developed, links to the videos tested on turtlebot are provided in the report.

For more details refer to report.
